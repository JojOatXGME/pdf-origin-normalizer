PDF Origin Normalizer
=====================

The application is used to move the origin of *PDF* files to the bottom
left of the trim box. I do not know much about the structure of PDF
files and *PDFBox* (library used). It is a *hacky* solution to fix
misplaced backgrounds in documents generated by *PDF24*.

Context
-------

There is a feature in PDF24 to set a background for generated PDF
documents. This backgrounds itself are PDFs as well. When using the
PDF24 printer, the background PDF is used as background in newly created
PDFs. I had the issue that PDF24 seems to assume that the origin of the
PDF is at the bottom left corner. This is a convention but it may not be
true on some PDFs. This application should fix such PDFs that should be
used as background.

Usage
-----

The application accepts two arguments in order.

 1. `<input file>`  
    Path to the PDF file that should be processed.

 2. `<output file>`  
    Path where the application should save the result.
